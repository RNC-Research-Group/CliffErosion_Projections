========================================================================
From: Landcare Research

Description:
  The New Zealand Fundamental Soil Layer originates from a relational join of
  features from two databases: the New Zealand Land Resource Inventory (NZLRI),
  and the National Soils Database (NSD). The NZLRI is a national polygon database
  of physical land resource information, including a soil unit. Soil is one in an
  inventory of five physical factors (including rock, slope, erosion, and
  vegetation) delineated by physiographic polygons at approximately 1:50,000
  scale. The NSD is a point database of soil physical, chemical, and mineralogical
  characteristics for over 1500 soil profiles nationally. A relational join
  between the NZLRI dominant soil and derivative tables from the NSD was the means
  by which 14 important soil attributes were attached to the NZLRI polygons. Some
  if these attributes originate from exact matches with NSD records, while others
  derive from matches to similar soils or professional estimates. This layer
  contains attributes relating to soil drainage. Soil drainage is described as a
  class. Drainage classes are assessed using criteria of soil depth and duration
  of water tables inferred from soil colours and mottles. Drainage classes used
  here are the same as those used in the NZ Soil Classification (Hewitt 1993), and
  outlined by Milne et al. (1995).
