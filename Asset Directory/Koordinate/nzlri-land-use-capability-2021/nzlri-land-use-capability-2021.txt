Description:
  The New Zealand Land Resource Inventory (NZLRI) is a national database of
  physical land resource information. It comprises two sets of data compiled using
  stereo aerial photography, published and unpublished reference material, and
  extensive field work:
  
  1. An inventory of five physical factors (rock type, soil, slope, present type
  and severity of erosion, and vegetation). A 'homogeneous unit area' approach is
  used to record the five physical factors simultaneously to a level of detail
  appropriate for presentation at a scale of 1:50,000.
  2. A Land Use Capability (LUC) rating of the ability of each polygon to sustain
  agricultural production, based on an assessment of the inventory factors above,
  climate, the effects of past land use, and the potential for erosion. The NZLRI
  covers the country in 11 regions, each with a separate LUC classification.
  
  The first edition NZLRI provides national coverage from mapping between 1973 and
  1979 at a scale of 1:63,360. A limited revision regional upgrade of the north
  Waikato area was completed at a scale of 1:63,360 in 1983. Second edition NZLRI
  regional upgrades at a scale of 1:50,000 have been completed for Northland,
  Wellington, Marlborough and Gisborne-East Cape. Third edition NZLRI layers
  contained a restructured polygon attribute table to allow the core NZLRI to
  complement the newly created fundamental soil layers with minimal duplication.
  
  Update of Edition 3 NZLRI. This update involves ++**no new mapping**++, but does
  include a ++**new National Land Use Capability legend**++ correlated for all
  regions across New Zealand. Attributes include original LUC units codes and unit
  descriptions so that users more familiar with original regional codes and North
  Island correlations can track the pedigree of units from old to new codes and
  descriptions.
